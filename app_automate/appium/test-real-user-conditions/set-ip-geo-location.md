# Set IP Geolocation


BrowserStack's IP Geolocation feature allows you to simulate website and mobile behavior from different locations by selecting IP addresses hosted in 45+ countries around the world. By incorporating IP geolocation into your tests, you can verify scenarios such as localized pricing, languages, product listings and much more.

With IP geolocation enabled, traffic to your website or mobile app will originate from an IP address hosted in the country you have chosen. With over 45+ countries to choose from, you can now test how your website or mobile app behaves across the world.

> Note: 
IP geolocation is a paid feature on BrowserStack. [Contact sales](https://www.browserstack.com/contact#sales) for details
