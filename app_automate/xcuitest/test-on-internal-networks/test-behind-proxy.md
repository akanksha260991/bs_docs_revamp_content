Test apps that retrieve data from servers behind proxies
If you have correctly set up Local Testing but are still unable to load your app's assets on remote mobile devices, then you are probably behind a proxy.

You can test apps serving content from private or internal servers that are behind proxiesâ€”on our remote mobile devices. Refer to this article to find proxy settings on your computer or contact your network/IT team.

Currently, we only support Local Testing through the following proxies:

1. Proxy with no authentication or HTTP Basic Authentication.
2. MITM proxy with no authentication or HTTP Basic Authentication.
3. PAC (Proxy Auto-Configuration) with no authentication.


Note: For Local Testing to work correctly, bypass traffic for bs-local.com in your proxy server.
