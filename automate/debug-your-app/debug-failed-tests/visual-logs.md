# Visual Logs #

Visual Logs automatically capture screenshots at every Selenium command executed during your test. They help debug issues detected through your Selenium tests. Visual logs help with debugging the exact step and the page where the failure occurred. They also help identify any layout or design related issues with your web pages on different browsers.


Visual Logs are disabled by default. In order to enable Visual Logs you will need to set ```browserstack.debug```capability to ```true```.

**Access Visual Logs from Automate Dashboard:**
