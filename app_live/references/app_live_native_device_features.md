# Native Device Features

### Introduction

App Live enables you to use native device features to test your mobile app on thousands of real Android & iOS devices in our Real Device Cloud. With our intuitive interface and native behaviour support, you can instantly get started.

### Features

#### Natural Gestures and Interactions

Interact with your mobile app on the remote device, just as you would with a real device in hand. Use trackpad to scroll, swipe, tap, long press, and pinch to zoom.

Support for long press on iOS 10 and above is on our roadmap.

### App Store

Login with your Apple ID to install apps from Apple App Store.

> Note
1. We do NOT store user details of Apple ID account used for sign-in. After every session, we sign out any existing user accounts, wipe all the data and bring the device back to pristine state.
2. This feature is only enabled for paid users.
3. This feature is available for devices on iOS 10 and above.

### Play Store

Login with your Google account to install apps from Google Play Store.

> Note
1. We do NOT store user details of Google account used for sign-in. After every session, we sign out any existing user accounts, wipe all the data and bring the device back to pristine state.
2. This feature is only enabled for paid users.

### TestFlight

Our iOS devices are pre-installed with TestFlight. Login to the app with your Apple ID to directly install and test your beta apps distributed for internal/external testing.

> Note
1. We do NOT store user details of Apple ID account used for sign-in. After every session, we sign out any existing user accounts, wipe all the data and bring the device back to pristine state.
2. This feature is available for devices on iOS 10 and above.

### GPS Geolocation testing

GPS Geolocation testing allows you to simulate the location of the device to a specific GPS location in order to test the location based scenarios for your app.

All our devices have GPS enabled. To simulate GPS Geolocation, use our in-session toolbar to simulate location of device by using our easy to use map interface or specifying longitude and latitude.

### IP Geolocation testing

IP Geolocation allows you to test location-based scenarios from 45+ countries across the globe. In order to use IP, use our in-session toolbar to choose the country of origin.

### Localization testing

Localization testing allows you to test your mobile app in different language and region settings. Use our in-session toolbar to set your required locale and start testing.

> Note
1. For Android, selecting a language updates the device Settings. Keyboard language may or may not change depending upon device's native behavior.
2. For iOS, selecting a language and region restarts the app with applied changes.
3. For iOS, this feature is available for devices on iOS 10 and above.

### Push Notifications

Push Notifications are enabled for both development and published apps. This feature is available for both Android and iOS devices.

> Note
1. For iOS, this feature is available for devices on iOS 10 and above.
2. To test push notification for iOS apps in development, install app via TestFlight.

### Camera access

If your app requires to access the phone camera, you will be able to do that on BrowserStack devices. However, all our device cameras are taped hence on accessing the camera you will see a black screen but you will be able to take picture and complete your testing flow.

### Pre-loaded images

The gallery in each device includes pre-set images and videos for your testing.

### Network Simulation

Network simulation allows you to test performance and behaviour of your app by simulating device network conditions. Use our in-session toolbar to switch between pre-set profiles such as 2G, 3G and 4G. You can also set your custom network profile by configuring bandwidth, latency and packet loss.

### Test dependent apps

Install multiple apps on the device and test inter-app flows between the dependent apps. Use 'Install app' option provided in the in-session toolbar to install your apps or install from App Store or Play Store.

### Device Orientation

Test your app in landscape or portrait mode. Use our in-session toolbar to switch between orientations.

### Google Pay

If your app uses Google Pay to take payments, you can test end to end Google Pay flow on BrowserStack devices. To test using Google Pay, login with your Google account on the device and start testing.

Don't worry, your Google account credentials are completely secured as we wipe the devices clean at the end of your session.

### Google In-app purchase

You can test in-app purchases for your Android app on BrowserStack devices. To test in-app purchases, login with your Google account on the device and start testing.

Don't worry, your Google account credentials are completely secured as we wipe the devices clean at the end of your session.

### Apple In-app purchase

You can test in-app purchases for your iOS app on BrowserStack devices. To test in-app purchases, login with your Apple Id account on the device and start testing.

Don't worry, your Apple Id credentials are completely secured as we wipe the devices clean at the end of your session.
